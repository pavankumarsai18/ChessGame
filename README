This project was fully developed by Venkata Sai Pavan Kumar Vadrevu and Luke Power.
This project is the submission for "Assignment X" for COP3252, Spring 2020.
This chess game is fully functional and supports features such as promotions, capturing en passant, and castling.
To begin playing, click on any of the white pawns, or white knights.

Promotion -- If a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board from the side it started on, the user will have the option to promote
their pawn to a queen, knight, bishop, or rook.

En passant capturing -- It is a special pawn capture that can only occur immediately after a pawn makes a move of two squares from
its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy pawn had it advanced only one square.

Castling -- make a special move (no more than once in a game by each player) in which the king is transferred from its original
square two squares along the back rank toward a rook on its corner square which is then transferred to the square passed over by the king.
