Wrote it in the order things came to my mind. Order in which the items appear do not imply that the things are ordered by importance.

1) Timer (Mode)
2) Tournatment (Mode)
3) MultiPlayer(Mode)
4) Save Feature (Saves the Board and whose turn it is next)
5) Layered Approach (For dragging the peice)
6) Trajectory of pieces when the sqaure is clicked(Color the squares)
7) Rotate the Board
8) Display the captured pieces on the left and the right of Layout
9) Change board layouts
10) Display all the previous moves

1)StaleMate (Debug and test)
2)KingsTrajectory
3)Winner (End game screen (Draw or Win)))
4)Promotion
